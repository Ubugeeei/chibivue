# chibi-vue
chibi-vue is minimam [Vue.js v3](https://github.com/vuejs/core) core implementations (reaactivity, vnode, component, compiler).

"chibi" means "small" in Japanese. 

This project began in February 2023 with the goal of simplifying the understanding of Vue's core implementation.

Currently, we are still in the process of implementation, but after implementation, we intend to post explanatory articles as well.

(For now, we plan to post Japanese first.)
